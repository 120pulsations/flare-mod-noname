# Flare

Flare is a a single-player 2D action RPG with fast-paced action and a dark fantasy style.

It is built on the FLARE engine (Free/Libre Action Roleplaying Engine). Its repo is at https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine

Flare uses simple file formats (INI style config files) for most of the game data, allowing anyone to easily modify game contents. Open formats are preferred (png, ogg). Maps are edited using Tiled.

## Installation

See the Flare-Engine repo for instructions on how to install Flare:

https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine

Flare Game is installed as a set of mods for Flare Engine. Place the contents of the "mods" folder inside Flare Engine's mods folder.

* On Windows, the mods folder will be in the same directory as the flare executable.
* On OSX, this will be inside the Flare.app folder, in Resources/mods 
* On Linux, the default location of the mods folder is /usr/local/share/flare/mods/

Then enable these mods in Flare's Configuration screen.

## Settings

Settings are stored in one of these places:

    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/flare
    $HOME/.config/flare
    ./config

Here you can enable fullscreen, change the game resolution, enable mouse-move, and change keybindings. The settings files are created the first time you run Flare.

## Save Files

Save files are stored in one of these places:

    $XDG_DATA_HOME/flare
    $HOME/.local/share/flare
    ./saves

If permissions are correct, the game is automatically saved when you exit.

## Packaging and Distributing

If you are packaging Flare Game for release (e.g. on an operating system's software repo), we suggest creating two packages.

* flare-engine the package that contains the single engine reused by several games
* flare-game, a package that requires flare-engine that only contains this game data

When distributing flare-game you may elect to omit these folders which are not used at runtime.

* art_src contains the raw files (e.g. Blender files) used to generate Flare's art.
* tiled contains the Tiled-native map files used to export Flare's maps
